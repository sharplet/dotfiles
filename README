Adam Sharp's dotfiles
=====================

Here's how I have this set up on my machine:

 - I have this repo checked out under ~/.dotfiles/

 - I have a symbolic link in my home directory for each of the dotfiles
	 in the repository, e.g.:

      $ cd
      $ ln -sf ~/.dotfiles/bash_profile .bash_profile

   This enables me to keep these dotfiles under version control.
